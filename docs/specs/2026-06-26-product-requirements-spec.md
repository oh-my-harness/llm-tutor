## 4A. Persistent Tutors

- REQ-060: The Tutor surface shall manage persistent tutor entities rather
  than act as another capability mode. Status: implemented.
- REQ-061: A tutor shall own a user-editable Markdown Soul, default model,
  allowed capabilities, resource permissions, conversation collection, and
  private Tutor Memory. Soul defines stable identity and teaching behavior;
  changing learning goals belong to Tutor Memory. Status: implemented except
  for the tutor conversation collection and stronger autonomous-write policy.
- REQ-062: The new-conversation empty state shall let the user optionally choose
  a tutor before the first message. Status: implemented.
- REQ-063: When no tutor is selected, the product shall use Temporary Assistant
  for a one-off conversation without persistent identity or private Tutor
  Memory. Temporary Assistant need not appear as a duplicate tutor-list item.
  Status: implemented.
- REQ-064: Tutor identity and capability mode shall remain separate concepts:
  the tutor is who accompanies the learner, while Chat, Research, Quiz, and
  Deep Solve describe what it is doing. Status: implemented.
- REQ-065: Tutor-bound sessions shall persist an immutable `tutor_id` beside
  the runtime session mapping. Changing tutors shall create a new session or a
  bounded handoff rather than replacing identity in place. Status: implemented
  for immutable binding and new-session creation; handoff remains planned.
- REQ-066: Authorized tutors may read shared Learner Memory, but each tutor's
  commitments, open loops, lesson plans, reflections, and strategy shall remain
  private by default. Status: implemented.
- REQ-067: Tutor Memory shall be visible, editable, removable, resettable,
  source-linked, and lifecycle-aware. It shall not duplicate the complete
  learner profile or store sensitive data and external factual claims.
  Status: implemented for storage, lifecycle, source session, and management;
  hard content-policy validation remains in progress.
- REQ-068: Tutor context shall combine Soul and permissions, relevant Learner
  Memory, relevant private Tutor Memory, runtime session history, and current
  resources through thin mappings to runtime APIs. Status: implemented for
  Soul, runtime history, model defaults, permission-filtered current resources,
  and bounded active Tutor Memory.
- REQ-068A: Soul Markdown shall be injected only as bounded product-owned
  runtime instruction. It shall not be parsed to grant capabilities, tools, or
  resource access and cannot override safety policy. Status: implemented.
- REQ-069: Deleting or resetting a tutor shall not implicitly delete global
  Learner Memory, Notebook, Knowledge, Quiz, or Space assets. Status:
  implemented for archive and profile reset; permanent deletion remains
  planned.
- REQ-069A: The detailed product contract and MVP sequence shall follow
  `docs/specs/2026-07-15-persistent-tutor-design.md`. Status: active.

## 5. Chat Mode

- REQ-070: Chat mode shall answer open-ended user questions.

- REQ-074: Chat mode shall be able to use `code_exec`.
- REQ-075: Chat mode shall require web search for current, external, or fact-collection requests.
- REQ-076: Chat mode shall avoid inventing facts when web search or fetch fails.
- REQ-077: Chat mode shall display citations only when the agent actually used a citation-producing tool.
- REQ-078: Chat mode shall not add backend-invented RAG citations when `rag_search` was not actually called.
- REQ-079: Chat mode shall support user-selected `@` references to Space artifacts. Status: implemented.
- REQ-080: `@` references shall be stored as structured artifact references, not only as plain text mentions. Status: implemented.
- REQ-081: The first supported `@` reference targets shall include Notebook entries, Quiz sessions, and Quiz questions. Status: implemented.
- REQ-082: The chat composer shall display selected `@` references as removable chips. Status: implemented.
- REQ-083: The `@` reference picker shall search Space artifacts by title, type, and useful metadata. Status: implemented.
- REQ-084: Mentioned Space artifact IDs shall be persisted with the user message and restored with the session. Status: implemented.
- REQ-085: Agents shall access mentioned Space artifacts through product tools such as `read_space_item` where possible, instead of blindly injecting long artifact content into every prompt. Status: implemented for Chat and Research.
- REQ-086: When an agent uses mentioned Space artifact content in an answer, the response shall identify the relevant artifact or cite it through the product reference system. Status: planned.
- REQ-087: Ordinary Chat messages shall expose role-appropriate actions through
  a compact message action toolbar that appears on pointer hover or keyboard
  focus without covering message content or shifting conversation layout.
  Assistant actions shall include Copy, Quote, Save to Notebook, and Regenerate
  where supported; user actions shall include Copy, Quote, and Edit. Quoting a
  message shall add a structured or clearly delimited reference to the composer.
  Status: implemented for Copy, Quote, Research-mode Save to Notebook,
  Regenerate, Sources, and user Edit actions.
- REQ-088: Ordinary assistant text shall use a transparent, document-like
  presentation that blends into the Chat background and may use the full Chat
  content lane. Ordinary user messages shall remain visually distinct as
  right-aligned light-gray bubbles with a bounded maximum width. Status: implemented.
- REQ-089: Structured product results such as Research reports, Quiz cards,
  approval requests, Notebook edit proposals, and workflow status surfaces
  shall retain purpose-built card or status presentation instead of inheriting
  ordinary message bubble styling. Citation sources shall remain a separate,
  expandable surface reached through a compact `Sources N` message action when
  appropriate. Status: implemented; structured results retain their dedicated
  components and ordinary citation lists remain separate from the toolbar.

## 6. Attachments

## 13. Quiz

- REQ-270: Users shall be able to generate a Quiz from a selected knowledge base.
- REQ-271: Users shall be able to generate a Quiz from conversation material.
- REQ-272: Users shall generate Quiz content from Chat using conversation context, attachments, selected knowledge sources, or user-referenced saved material; Notebook and Research report pages shall not provide independent Quiz generation entry points. Status: implemented for conversation, attachments, knowledge bases, and `@` Space references.

- REQ-279: Users shall be able to answer Quiz questions.
- REQ-280: Users shall get immediate correctness feedback.
- REQ-281: Users shall see final score summary.
- REQ-282: Users shall see missed-question review.

- REQ-285: Quiz shall support short-answer judging. Status: planned.
- REQ-286: Quiz shall support wrong-answer review records. Status: planned.
- REQ-287: Quiz shall support adaptive difficulty. Status: planned.
- REQ-288: Quiz shall be exposed to Chat as an enabled agent capability/tool, not as an automatic "send equals generate" mode. Status: implemented with `propose_quiz_plan` and `create_quiz` product tools.
- REQ-289: When Quiz capability is enabled, normal chat turns shall allow discussion of scope, source material, difficulty, question type, learner level, citation strictness, and review goals before any Quiz is generated. Status: implemented through normal Chat plus optional `propose_quiz_plan`.
- REQ-290: The agent shall call a dedicated `create_quiz` product tool only after the user explicitly asks to generate, confirms a plan, or provides an unambiguous generation request. Status: implemented in tool design/prompt contract; needs behavioral QA across providers.
- REQ-291: Quiz generation shall separate user instruction from source material. The latest user message may guide topic and constraints, but it shall not be treated as factual source material unless no other source is available or the user explicitly says it is source material. Status: partially implemented through `kb_id`, `notebook_entry_id`, `source_text`, and `source_label`; needs stronger UI/agent guardrails.
- REQ-292: A successful `create_quiz` tool call shall save the Quiz into Quiz Bank and render an interactive Quiz card in Chat. Status: implemented.
- REQ-293: Quiz planning may use learner memory for personalization, but generated factual answers and citations shall remain grounded in selected source material. Status: implemented for first slice; L3 memory is passed only for personalization when review/practice intent is detected.
- REQ-294: Quiz generation shall include a verifier stage inside the controlled product flow, not as a separate free-form chat agent. Status: implemented with deterministic validation plus a structured LLM verifier running inside the runtime `WorkflowEngine`.
- REQ-295: The verifier stage shall receive only the source chunks, candidate question JSON, answer, explanation, citations, and supporting quote needed for review. Status: implemented.
- REQ-296: The verifier stage shall return structured review output such as `verdict`, `issues`, `supported_answer`, `explanation_consistent`, `citation_supports_answer`, and optional repair guidance. Status: partially implemented with `verdict` and `issues`; richer booleans and repair guidance are planned.
- REQ-297: The verifier shall judge only against supplied source material and shall not introduce external knowledge or new factual claims. Status: implemented in prompt contract; needs provider-behavior QA.
- REQ-298: Questions that fail deterministic validation or verifier review shall not be saved as final Quiz questions unless they are repaired and re-verified. Status: implemented for first slice through runtime workflow repair and final publish validation.
- REQ-299: The first verifier implementation may retry or repair failed questions once, then discard unresolved questions rather than publishing weakly grounded content. Status: implemented for first slice with a bounded runtime workflow repair loop.
- REQ-299A: Interactive Quiz cards rendered inside Chat shall be durable message attachments linked to the saved Quiz session, not only transient WebSocket/UI state. Leaving and returning to the session shall restore the card and keep it answerable. Status: implemented.
- REQ-299B: If a Quiz is generated while the user switches to another session, the completed `create_quiz` tool result shall remain attached to the originating assistant message and be restored when the user returns. Status: implemented.

Current Quiz verification flow:

1. `create_quiz` builds source material from one of these sources: selected knowledge base chunks, a Notebook entry, explicit `source_text`, or selected Chat/Space material.
2. If a usable LLM config exists, the quiz runtime workflow definition is validated before generation: `collect_sources -> generate_questions -> verify_questions -> publish_questions`, with a bounded repair edge from verifier back to generation.
3. `tutor_agent::quiz::generate_quiz_questions_with_workflow` runs the controlled quiz flow through runtime `WorkflowEngine`.
4. The `generate_questions` runtime LLM step submits structured single-choice question JSON through `submit_step_result`.
5. The `verify_questions` runtime LLM step reviews generated questions against the supplied source chunks and submits a structured pass/fail result.
6. Failed verifier results route back to `generate_questions` once for repair; unresolved failures do not reach final publish.
7. The `publish_questions` executor deterministically validates JSON shape, option consistency, citations, and supporting quotes before storage.
8. If no usable LLM config exists, the backend uses a deterministic fallback question generator from source chunks.
9. The backend converts verified questions into stored `QuizQuestion` records and maps cited source indices to `QuizCitation` metadata.
10. `validate_quiz_questions_for_storage` rejects empty question sets, empty stems, too-few options, missing correct option IDs, empty explanations, missing citations, and empty citation text.
11. The stored quiz receives a `QuizVerificationReport` with method `llm_verifier_and_citation_check` or `deterministic_fallback_citation_check`.

Remaining hardening: richer verifier booleans and repair guidance can be added later, but the runtime `WorkflowEngine` execution and bounded repair/retry loop are now implemented.

## 14. Research

- REQ-300: Users shall be able to select Research mode in chat.
- REQ-301: Research mode shall create a brief research plan.
- REQ-302: Research mode shall call `web_search` for external facts.
- REQ-303: Research mode shall call `web_fetch` for important sources.
- REQ-304: Research mode shall optionally call `rag_search` when a knowledge base is selected.
- REQ-305: Research mode shall produce a Markdown report.
- REQ-306: Research reports shall include a structured title. The explicit workflow title is authoritative; the first Markdown heading and then the research request are fallback sources. Status: implemented.
- REQ-307: Research reports shall include a summary.
- REQ-308: Research reports shall include key findings.
- REQ-309: Research reports shall include analysis.
- REQ-310: Research reports shall include limitations.
- REQ-311: Research reports shall include follow-up questions.
- REQ-312: Research reports shall include sources.
- REQ-313: Research progress shall appear as compact status, not normal assistant bubbles.
- REQ-314: Research trace events shall include planning, search, read, and report completion.
- REQ-315: Research mode shall clearly state when search or fetch failed.
- REQ-316: Research mode shall not cite sources that were not actually searched or fetched.
- REQ-317: Research reports shall be saved as `NotebookEntry` records with `type = research_report`. Status: implemented.
- REQ-318: Research reports shall restore with structured metadata from Notebook entries after save and from durable runtime trace attachments before save. Status: implemented for report title, Markdown, source metadata, and unavailable-artifact fallback.
- REQ-319: The UI shall provide a dedicated ResearchReport component. Status: implemented.
- REQ-320: The UI shall show a dedicated source list under each Research report. Status: implemented.
- REQ-321: Research reports shall support regeneration/versioning. Status: implemented for the first slice with a report Regenerate action and Notebook report metadata carrying version and generation details.
- REQ-322: Research shall support longer-running multi-step/parallel deep research. Status: implemented for the first slice by allowing the runtime Research workflow search step to spawn independent subtopic agents through `sync_spawn_agent`.
- REQ-323: Research mode shall preserve normal conversational interaction for clarifying research goals, scope, source preferences, output format, depth, time range, and optional Notebook or Knowledge Base context before starting detailed research. Ordinary Research Chat turns shall stream like normal Chat until a report-generation tool call starts. Status: implemented with Research TextDelta routed through the normal final-answer stream before the `create_research_report` tool boundary.
- REQ-324: Research mode shall provide a detailed research workflow that can be explicitly started after the user's need is clear. The workflow shall cover search, source reading, source selection, synthesis, citation checking, and report generation; it shall not be forced for every Research message. The target architecture shall align with Quiz generation: the outer Research Chat agent calls a dedicated `create_research_report` product tool, and that tool runs the runtime `WorkflowEngine` and returns structured report metadata. Status: implemented for the first tool-boundary slice with the previous keyword/confirmation pre-router removed from the Research capability entrypoint.
- REQ-325: Long-running Research runs shall have a durable run identity and status so users can switch sessions, return later, and see the current stage or final report without starting a duplicate workflow. Status: implemented for in-process rejoin; after process restart an active run restores as interrupted pending runtime resume support.
- REQ-326: Research progress and final report attachments shall be restorable from runtime session state and product records after navigation, refresh, or desktop restart. Status: implemented for current stage, terminal state, report metadata, and report attachment; full progress replay and execution resume remain pending on runtime support.

## 14A. Background Runs and Session Rejoin

- REQ-330: Long-running agent turns shall continue when the user leaves the
  current session unless the user explicitly cancels them or the backend fails.
  Status: implemented for in-process runs; process loss restores an explicit
  interrupted state because the runtime cannot yet resume execution.
- REQ-331: The UI shall be able to rejoin an active run by stable run/session
  identifiers and show queued, running, waiting, failed, cancelled, or completed
  state. Status: implemented for in-process rejoin and persisted terminal or
  interrupted state after restart.
- REQ-332: Chat messages shall persist tool result attachments and stable
  references to product artifacts such as Quiz sessions and Notebook research
  reports. Status: implemented for Quiz session references and Research runtime
  trace references, with Notebook references after explicit save.
- REQ-333: Reconnecting to a session shall not start a duplicate workflow for an
  already-active run. Status: implemented for in-process runs.
- REQ-334: The implementation shall prefer runtime session/run persistence from
  `llm-harness-runtime` / `llm-harness-agent`; missing framework primitives
  shall be recorded in `docs/framework-feedback.md`. Status: implemented; the
  durable resume/replay gap is recorded there.
- REQ-335: Leaving and returning to an in-process running session shall restore
  the assistant text generated so far and continue streaming from the same run.
  Snapshot capture and live subscription shall not lose deltas between them.
  Status: implemented.
- REQ-336: WebSocket events and asynchronous session hydration shall be scoped
  to their originating session. Rapid session switching shall not apply stale
  content, completion, close, or HTTP responses to the newly selected session.
  Status: implemented.
- REQ-337: While any session is marked active in the sidebar, the UI shall
  periodically reconcile run state with the backend so a completion event missed
  during navigation cannot leave a permanent running indicator. Status:
  implemented.

## 15. Retired Books Capability

Product decision recorded on 2026-07-14: Books are no longer a target product
capability. Notebook is the single durable destination for research reports and
other generated learning records.

- REQ-340 through REQ-357: The former Book viewing, creation, chapter,
  conversion, editing, export, and retrieval requirements are retired and
  shall not drive future implementation.
- REQ-358: Product navigation and report/Notebook actions shall not expose Book
  creation, chapter creation, or save-to-Book workflows. Book UI, routes,
  stores, source targets, and compatibility code shall be removed. Status:
  implemented.

- REQ-818: Agent autonomous Notebook/Vault exploration shall be available only when the chat source selector is associated with Notebook. Status: planned.
- REQ-819: When Notebook is not associated and the user has not explicitly `@` mentioned a Notebook entry, the agent shall not silently search or read Notebook content. Status: planned.
- REQ-820: Explicit `@` Notebook references shall still allow reading the referenced entry through `read_space_item`, even when Notebook is not the associated source. Status: planned.
- REQ-821: Notebook/Vault maintenance capabilities such as edit proposals, link suggestions, tag cleanup, move/rename proposals, duplicate review, merge proposals, and new-note proposals shall be enabled only in Organize mode. Status: planned.
- REQ-822: Non-Organize modes may answer from explicitly referenced or associated Notebook content, but shall not initiate Notebook maintenance proposals unless the session is switched to Organize mode. Status: planned.
- REQ-823: Notebook exploration tools shall be vault-aware and return stable ids together with paths, titles, entry types, tags, snippets, and link/backlink metadata where available. Status: planned.
- REQ-824: Notebook maintenance tools shall remain proposal-only; applying changes shall require user confirmation and shall execute through product Notebook APIs, not direct agent file-system writes. Status: planned.
- REQ-825: Notebook file browsing shall use lightweight tree/list metadata and shall not return full Markdown bodies in the file browser payload. Status: implemented.
- REQ-826: Notebook shall load full Markdown content only when a note is opened or explicitly read by an agent/product tool. Status: implemented.
- REQ-827: Notebook shall avoid a blocking full Vault rescan every time the Notebook tab is opened or revisited. Status: implemented.
- REQ-828: Notebook shall provide an explicit Vault refresh/reconcile operation for users to force external file changes to be indexed. Status: implemented.
- REQ-829: Notebook indexing shall track file stats such as relative path, modified time, and size so unchanged files can be skipped during refresh. Status: implemented.
- REQ-830: The desktop app shall use a file watcher for bound Notebook Vault directories where possible, with debounced index updates. Status: implemented.
- REQ-831: Notebook shall keep folder expansion state and selected note state stable across tab switches and non-destructive refreshes. Status: implemented.
- REQ-832: Notebook shall show indexing status such as watching, refreshing, last refreshed time, and changed-file count when available. Status: implemented.
- REQ-833: Notebook file tree rendering shall be designed to support large Vaults, including lazy folder expansion or virtualization when needed. Status: implemented with virtualized visible-row rendering.
- REQ-834: Notebook shall use an editor-style data model where the Vault files, Notebook index, file watcher, frontend explorer, open note buffer, and relation panels are separate responsibilities. Status: planned.
- REQ-835: Opening the Notebook page shall render from the current lightweight index first; full Markdown bodies and selected-note relations shall load only after a note is opened. Status: implemented for note body loading; relation-panel loading remains planned.
- REQ-836: Notebook create-note and create-folder actions shall be scoped to the currently selected folder or an explicit target folder. Status: planned.
- REQ-837: Notebook rename, move, and delete actions shall update the Markdown file path and Notebook index together and shall report affected links when link rewriting is not performed automatically. Status: planned.
- REQ-838: Notebook shall render Obsidian-style `[[wiki links]]` as navigable internal links and shall provide a clear unresolved-link path such as creating the missing target note. Status: partially implemented; link parsing and basic navigation exist, unresolved-link creation remains planned.

- REQ-841: Saving generated Chat or Research content to Notebook shall ask the user to choose a Notebook-relative destination before creating the entry. Status: implemented.
- REQ-842: When Notebook uses app-owned storage, the destination chooser shall be an app-owned Notebook folder tree rather than an operating-system file picker, because Notebook folders are product-owned logical paths. Status: implemented.
- REQ-843: The Notebook folder tree chooser shall support expanding and collapsing folders, selecting the Notebook root or an existing folder, and creating a new folder without leaving the save flow. Status: implemented.
- REQ-844: The save flow shall display the resulting Notebook-relative folder, file name, and full logical path before confirmation, and shall prevent invalid or conflicting paths. Status: implemented.
- REQ-845: The save flow should remember the most recently selected Notebook folder and use it as the next default when that folder still exists; otherwise it shall fall back to the Notebook root. Status: implemented.
- REQ-846: After a successful save, the UI shall confirm the destination and offer a direct action to open the created Notebook entry. Status: implemented.
- REQ-847: When desktop Notebook is bound to a user-visible external Vault, saving generated content shall use the native system Save dialog rooted at that Vault, accept Markdown destinations only, reject destinations outside the bound Vault, and convert the selected path to a Notebook-relative path before writing through Notebook APIs. Status: implemented.
- REQ-848: Saving to Notebook and exporting Markdown shall remain distinct commands: save creates or updates a Notebook-owned entry, while export writes a portable file or archive to an arbitrary user-selected local destination. Status: implemented for command and ownership separation; native desktop export destinations remain planned under REQ-849.
- REQ-849: Desktop Markdown export shall use a native system file dialog, while web/dev export shall use the platform-supported download flow. Status: planned.
- REQ-850: Saving generated Research content shall use the structured report title as the initial Notebook title and native Save-dialog file name; Markdown heading and request-derived titles are fallbacks, not the first prose sentence. Status: implemented.

  through Notebook. Status: implemented.
- REQ-697: Memory shall support an L2 per-surface summary layer. Status: implemented.
- REQ-698: L2 shall include `chat.md`. Status: implemented.
- REQ-699: L2 shall include `quiz.md`. Status: implemented.

- REQ-715: The product shall provide a `read_memory` tool for agents. Status: implemented.
- REQ-716: Agents shall call `read_memory` when personalized teaching, quiz generation, review planning, or long-running learning context requires it. Status: implemented through tool-aware runtime instructions.
- REQ-717: Memory shall not be injected wholesale into every prompt by default. Status: implemented.
- REQ-718: `write_memory` shall be limited to explicit user preferences or user-approved facts. Status: implemented in runtime policy and tool contract.

- REQ-720: Memory Markdown footnote refs shall render as clickable inline source chips. Status: implemented.
- REQ-721: Clicking an inline memory source chip shall scroll to the corresponding bottom reference item. Status: implemented.
- REQ-722: Clicking a bottom memory reference item shall navigate to the related
  Chat, Notebook (including saved Research reports), Quiz, or Knowledge Base
  surface when possible. Book and Research-specific references are no longer
  supported. Status: implemented for current reference targets.
- REQ-723: Internal memory entry markers such as `<!--m_xxx-->` shall never be displayed in rendered Markdown. Status: implemented by Markdown rendering while remaining available in source/edit mode.
- REQ-724: The Memory LLM workspace shall require an explicit maintenance mode
  (`update`, `check`, or `dedupe`) and model selection before the user starts a
  run; selecting either control shall not start the workflow by itself. Status:
  implemented.
- REQ-725: The selected Memory model shall be resolved from the user's saved LLM
  configurations and passed to the existing `tutor.memory` workflow for that
  run. Status: implemented.
- REQ-726: The Memory document shall occupy the primary workspace area. The
  memory-file rail and LLM workspace shall use compact controls and restrained
  fixed widths so document reading and editing remain the visual priority.
  Status: implemented.
- REQ-727: The Memory workbench agent shall have read-only, on-demand access to
  all L1 event surfaces; all L1 evidence shall be addressable without being
  injected wholesale into the initial prompt. Status: implemented.
- REQ-728: The Memory workflow shall provide bounded tools to list and search
  L1 events, read an event, read surrounding source context, and resolve the
  original product artifact. Status: partially implemented; list, search,
  event, context, and complete event-snapshot reads are available, while
  product-artifact resolution remains follow-up work.
- REQ-729: L1 evidence tools shall use pagination, support cancellation and
  budgets, and shall not expose arbitrary filesystem access. Status: partially
  implemented; pagination and the read-only boundary are implemented, while
  explicit budgets remain.
- REQ-730: L1 events shall have stable event-level or turn-level references;
  multiple events in one session shall not collapse to a shared session-only
  citation identity. Status: implemented.
- REQ-731: L1 events shall preserve either a complete evidence snapshot or a
  durable pointer that resolves to the complete source content. Status:
  partially implemented; Chat events, including Research clarification turns,
  preserve complete exchanges, while remaining product surfaces require a full
  pointer audit.
- REQ-732: A Memory run shall begin with the target surface and may explicitly
  expand evidence discovery to other L1 surfaces. Cross-surface expansion shall
  be visible in the run flow. Status: implemented.
- REQ-733: Every L1 list, search, and read performed by the Memory agent shall
  be represented in trace and product-level flow progress. Status: implemented.
- REQ-734: Every agent-proposed Memory change shall cite evidence that was
  actually read during that run; unread, unknown, or stale refs shall be
  rejected by product validation. Status: implemented.
- REQ-735: The right Memory workbench shall display run controls, flow state,
  evidence and change counts, validation, errors, cancellation, retry, and a
  compact completion summary. It shall not display a full document draft as the
  normal run result. Status: partially implemented; flow, validation errors,
  change counts, and summaries are present, while cancellation and retry remain.
- REQ-736: Memory runs shall expose product-level states for queueing, source
  discovery, evidence reading, analysis, change proposal, validation, review,
  apply, completion, failure, and cancellation. Status: implemented.
- REQ-737: The Memory agent shall return a structured change set rather than a
  complete `proposed_markdown` document. Status: implemented.
- REQ-738: A Memory change set shall include the run id, target path, base
  revision, compact summary, findings, and independently reviewable insert,
  replace, or delete operations. Status: implemented.
- REQ-739: Each proposed operation shall include stable target anchors where
  applicable, changed text where applicable, source refs, and a human-readable
  reason. Stable entry ids and sections shall be preferred over line numbers.
  Status: implemented.
- REQ-740: The central Memory document area shall provide Read, Edit, and Review
  modes. Review mode shall render a deterministic diff generated by product
  code from the validated change set. Status: implemented.
- REQ-741: Memory diff review shall distinguish insertions, deletions, and
  replacements and shall show each change's reason and navigable source refs.
  Status: implemented.
- REQ-742: Users shall be able to accept or reject each Memory change and to
  accept or reject all pending changes. Status: implemented.
- REQ-743: Agent-produced Memory changes shall not modify persistent documents
  before explicit user confirmation. Status: implemented.
- REQ-744: Before apply, the product shall validate the target revision,
  operation and anchors, allowed sections, text limits, and source refs.
  Status: implemented.
- REQ-745: Accepted Memory changes shall be applied atomically, recorded in
  history, and reversible through undo. Status: implemented.
- REQ-746: If the target document has changed since the run's base revision,
  apply shall stop and require a rebase or rerun instead of silently overwriting
  user edits. Status: implemented.
- REQ-747: The left Memory rail shall own compact file selection, the center
  shall own document reading/editing/diff review, and the right workbench shall
  own controls and flow progress. L1 shall not appear as ordinary editable
  memory files in the primary rail. Status: implemented.
- REQ-748: Leaving and returning to the Memory workspace shall rejoin the newest
  active or reviewable Memory run without starting a duplicate run. The UI
  shall restore its target file, flow state, and pending change review. Status:
  implemented.
- REQ-749: The left Memory file rail shall project the state of every active or
  reviewable Memory run onto its target module. Running work shall use an
  animated progress indicator, pending changes shall use a distinct review
  indicator, and both shall be restored after workspace navigation. Status:
  implemented.
- REQ-750: A Memory run shall capture the global interface language when the
  run starts and use it as the output language for newly generated summaries,
  findings, reasons, and inserted or replaced memory text across L2 and L3.
  Existing memory shall not be translated merely because the global language
  changes, and technical terms or proper nouns may remain in their source
  language. The captured language shall remain fixed for the lifetime of the
  run. Status: implemented.
- REQ-751: Active L2 memory shall consist of `chat.md`, `quiz.md`,
  `notebook.md`, and `knowledge.md`; it shall not create or expose a separate
  `research.md` target. Status: implemented.
- REQ-752: `notebook.md` shall summarize durable behavior across ordinary
  notes and saved Research reports, including organization habits, preferred
  formats, report preferences, recurring research themes, and unresolved
  questions. It shall not copy report bodies or external factual findings into
  learner memory. Status: implemented.
- REQ-753: Research workflow searches, fetched sources, intermediate progress,
  traces, and unsaved reports shall remain in Research runtime/session state
  and shall not be treated as L1 learner-memory evidence. Status: implemented.
- REQ-754: Existing `L2/research.md` content shall not be migrated or retained.
  The obsolete file may be removed when the active L2 catalog is updated.
  Status: implemented.
- REQ-755: `MemoryEventCategory::Research`, `L1/research_events.jsonl`, and the
  Research-specific memory source filter shall be removed without legacy data
  migration. Ordinary Research-mode conversation events shall be recorded as
  Chat L1 with their capability metadata preserved. Status: implemented.
- REQ-756: Saving a Research report to Notebook shall be the explicit boundary
  that makes the report eligible for long-term memory consolidation. The saved
  report shall produce or update Notebook L1 evidence and may inform
  `notebook.md`; an unsaved report shall not. Status: implemented.
- REQ-757: Once `create_research_report` starts, its search/fetch trace,
  structured report attachment, and report body shall be excluded from Chat L1
  recording. A saved report shall use the normal Notebook event and
  `notebook:` reference contract; no `research:` memory reference shall be
  created. Status: implemented.
- REQ-758: Ordinary L3 generation shall use stable L2 entries as its primary
  evidence and shall not behave as another all-surface L1 consolidation run.
  Status: planned.
- REQ-759: L3 evidence discovery shall provide bounded list, search, read, and
  L1-provenance drill-down tools for stable L2 entries. Candidate lists shall
  not make an entry citeable. Status: planned.
- REQ-760: L3 changes shall use canonical entry-level L2 references rather than
  bare surface names. Status: planned.
- REQ-761: `profile.md`, `scope.md`, and `preferences.md` shall synthesize from
  their documented L2 source matrix; `teaching_strategy.md` may additionally
  use accepted Profile, Scope, and Preferences without creating a circular
  dependency. Status: planned.
- REQ-762: `recent.md` may use bounded recent L1 events as an explicit
  chronology exception while retaining current L2 context. Status: planned.
- REQ-763: L3 runs shall check relevant L2 freshness before analysis and expose
  stale dependencies instead of silently rewriting multiple layers. Status:
  planned.
- REQ-764: The retired draft-oriented Memory assist and consolidation APIs,
  prompt-injected L3 chunk implementation, and bare-surface citation path shall
  be removed before the layered L3 runtime is introduced. Status: implemented.
- REQ-765: Agents shall treat `read_memory` as silent internal context loading
  and shall not narrate implementation details such as "checking memory" or
  "reading the memory file" in assistant answer text. Status: implemented.
- REQ-766: When learner memory is relevant and sufficiently supported, agents
  shall use it naturally as remembered context. They may answer directly or use
  conversational language such as "I remember" without naming the tool or
  storage layer. Status: implemented.
- REQ-767: Agents shall hedge or ask for confirmation when memory is weak,
  stale, ambiguous, or conflicting, and shall not claim to remember content
  when `read_memory` returned no supporting memory. Status: implemented.
- REQ-768: Silent memory use shall not remove observability. Memory tool calls
  remain available in trace, and an agent shall truthfully explain the relevant
  prior conversation, quiz, Notebook-derived summary, or learner memory when
  the user explicitly asks how it knows. Status: implemented.

- REQ-424: Settings shall support config import/export. Status: planned.
- REQ-425: Appearance colors shall be expressed through semantic theme tokens
  rather than component-local palette choices. The default `cool-light` theme
  shall use a cool-gray application frame and sidebar, a near-white Chat
  canvas, white assistant content surfaces, medium-gray user bubbles, and blue
  interaction accents. Status: implemented for the application shell,
  sidebar, Chat canvas, and ordinary messages.
- REQ-426: Settings shall allow users to select from multiple color themes,
  persist the selection locally, and apply it without restarting the app.
  The initial choices shall be `cool-light` and `graphite-dark`; changing only
  the theme shall not reset or replace the active conversation session.
  Status: implemented.
- REQ-427: The `graphite-dark` theme shall use neutral graphite framing, a
  near-black Chat canvas, elevated charcoal content surfaces, soft white text,
  and blue interaction accents. Ordinary text, muted text, controls, status
  colors, message surfaces, and scrollbars shall remain distinguishable without
  relying on pure-black backgrounds. Status: implemented for current product
  surfaces; continue migrating new component-local colors to semantic tokens.
